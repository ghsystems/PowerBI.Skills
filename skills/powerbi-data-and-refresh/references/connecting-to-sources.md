# Connecting to sources

Which connector for which source, and the shape of a clean staging query. Hosts and names here
are placeholders. Replace `yourinstance` and `yourtenant` with the real values in the model, and
keep real hosts out of any shared or committed file.

For a paged REST API, the loop and its guards live in `references/rest-paging-pattern.md`. For
the defensive transforms that keep a query alive when a source drifts, see
`references/m-hardening.md`.

## Picking the connector

| Source | Use | Not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REST or ServiceNow Table API | `Web.Contents` with a literal base URL, `RelativePath`, and `Query`, wrapped in the paging loop | One long concatenated URL string, which breaks credential binding in the Service |
| One Excel file on SharePoint | `Excel.Workbook(Web.Contents("<direct file url>"), null, true)` | `SharePoint.Files`, which crawls every file in the site first |
| Many files in one folder | `SharePoint.Files` filtered early, or `Folder.Files` on a synced path | A direct read per file, which does not scale |
| A file that moves or gets renamed | `SharePoint.Files`, accepting the crawl cost | A fixed path that breaks silently |
| Data that will never change again | A static blob frozen into the model, see the paging reference | Re-pulling closed history on every refresh |

## Reading an Excel file on SharePoint

Read the file directly. Do not enumerate the site.

```m
// GOOD: direct file read, fast
let
  Source = Excel.Workbook(
    Web.Contents("https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite/Shared%20Documents/Folder/File.xlsx"),
    null, true),
  Table1 = Source{[Item = "TableName", Kind = "Table"]}[Data]
in
  Table1
```

```m
// BAD for a single file: SharePoint.Files crawls every file in the whole site first,
// which can run for many minutes and cause a multi hour refresh.
let
  Source = SharePoint.Files("https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/YourSite", [ApiVersion = 15]),
  File   = Source{[Name = "File.xlsx"]}[Content]
in
  File
```

To get the exact direct URL, open the file location in the browser and use the path, or in the
file details pane copy the Path field. Avoid the share link with the `?e=` parameter, it is not
a clean path. Percent encode the spaces (`Shared%20Documents`). Literal spaces also work in
practice, but one form per model keeps the URLs greppable.

Do not use the SharePoint REST API for a normal file read:

```m
// AVOID: REST GetFileById. The file id survives a move, but the credential test is fragile
// and often fails with a 400 on the data source setup.
Web.Contents("https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/Site",
  [RelativePath = "_api/web/GetFileById('<file-id>')/$value"])
```

Put a `Timeout` on a workbook read the same way you would on an API call. A hung download costs
the same refresh minutes as a hung request.

### Kind is Sheet or Table, and they differ

`Excel.Workbook` returns both. A `Table` (a real Excel table object) arrives with headers already
correct. A `Sheet` is the raw grid, so you promote headers yourself and you own whatever title
rows sit above the data. Prefer a `Table` when the file has one.

### Do not hardcode a sheet or table name a business user can edit

Four patterns, all from a production model, for a workbook someone else maintains.

```m
// Pick the sheet by a predicate on its name, not by literal match
ActiveSheet = Table.SelectRows(Source,
  each [Kind] = "Sheet" and Text.Contains(Text.Lower([Name]), "active")){0}[Data],
```

```m
// Take the newest table when a new one appears each year (EPS_2026, EPS_2027, ...)
EPSNames  = Table.SelectRows(Source, each [Kind] = "Table" and Text.StartsWith([Item], "EPS_")),
TableName = List.Max(EPSNames[Item]),
Data      = Source{[Item = TableName, Kind = "Table"]}[Data],
Year      = try Number.FromText(Text.AfterDelimiter(TableName, "_"))
            otherwise error "Table name must end with a year like EPS_2026",
```

```m
// Find the header row inside a messy sheet instead of Table.Skip(n)
WithIndex = Table.AddIndexColumn(sheetData, "__idx", 0, 1, Int64.Type),
HeaderRow = Table.SelectRows(WithIndex,
              each Text.Trim(Text.From(Record.Field(_, Table.ColumnNames(sheetData){0}))) = "Company"),
HeaderIdx = if Table.RowCount(HeaderRow) = 0
            then error "Could not find a header row starting with 'Company'."
            else HeaderRow{0}[__idx],
Promoted  = Table.PromoteHeaders(Table.Skip(sheetData, HeaderIdx), [PromoteAllScalars = true]),
Trimmed   = Table.TransformColumnNames(Promoted, each Text.Trim(_)),
```

```m
// One sheet per year or region: fan out and combine in one workbook read
YearSheets  = Table.SelectRows(Source, each [Kind] = "Sheet" and IsYearSheet(Text.From([Item]))),
WithYear    = Table.AddColumn(YearSheets, "YearValue", each YearFromSheetName([Item]), Int64.Type),
Transformed = Table.AddColumn(WithYear, "Data2", each TransformSheet([Data], [YearValue]), type table),
Final       = Table.Combine(Transformed[Data2]),
```

`Table.Skip` with a hard coded number breaks the first time someone inserts a row above the
table. `Table.TransformColumnNames(..., each Text.Trim(_))` is the companion fix for headers
that carry a trailing space.

## Authentication notes (Pro)

- ServiceNow REST: Basic (user and password) or OAuth. Set it once in Desktop, and again in the
  Service under the dataset's data source credentials.
- SharePoint and SharePoint files and Excel on SharePoint: Organizational account (OAuth).
- Set privacy levels consistently. When two sources are combined in one query, mismatched
  privacy levels throw a Formula.Firewall error. For a single tenant, Organizational on all
  sources is usually right, and it does not cause the "operation cancelled" timeout error. The
  model level override is in `references/refresh-troubleshooting.md`.

## The literal first argument rule, and its one safe exception

The first argument to `Web.Contents` must be a constant. That is what lets the Service bind one
credential to one host and refresh on a schedule.

```m
Web.Contents("https://yourinstance.service-now.com", [RelativePath = ..., Query = ...])   // fine
WorkbookUrl = "https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/Site/File.xlsx",
Web.Contents(WorkbookUrl)                                                                  // also fine
Web.Contents("https://" & host & "/api/" & table)                                          // breaks in the Service
```

A `let` binding to a string constant is safe, and it reads better when the same URL is used
twice. What breaks the Service is a URL that is *computed* from data or a parameter. Keep
everything variable in `RelativePath` and `Query`.

## A clean staging query

Keep the raw pull in its own query, load disabled, do the reshape there, then let the model
tables build from it.

Then count how many things reference it. A referenced query re-runs in full every time,
including its network calls, and that count is the number that decides your refresh time. The
counting method and what to do about it are in `references/folding-and-duplication.md`.
