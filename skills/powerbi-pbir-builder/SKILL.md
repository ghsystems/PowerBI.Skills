  Write real report pages and visuals directly into an existing PBIP project by authoring
  PBIR JSON (page.json and visual.json) files. Use whenever the user wants to generate a
  report page, add a visual programmatically, build a KPI card, create a bar or line or area

  pattern across many pages, instead of clicking through Power BI Desktop by hand. Trigger on
  phrases like "add a page to the report", "write PBIR JSON", "generate this chart in code",
  "build a KPI card", "add a slicer", "automate the report layout", "create these visuals
  programmatically". Only adds to a PBIP that already exists. Does not create a PBIP from

# Power BI PBIR builder

Write report pages and visuals directly into an existing PBIP project's `.Report\definition`
folder, instead of clicking through Power BI Desktop by hand. Useful for generating many
similar visuals (a row of KPI cards, a page per region), or for scripting a layout once you
know the pattern.

Read this before any other reference in this skill: PBIR is a strict, brittle JSON format.
A single wrong bracket or an unknown property can stop the whole report from opening. Treat
every edit here as something to do carefully, not casually.

## When to use

Use this to ADD pages or visuals to a PBIP project that already exists. For choosing which
chart fits a question, picking colors, and general layout rules, use `powerbi-report-design`
first and bring the decision here to implement. For the model behind the visuals, use
`powerbi-modeling` and `powerbi-dax`. For safely hand editing the semantic model's TMDL, and
the general pbip safety rules, use `powerbi-project-and-tools`.

## Critical constraints, read first

1. **Never create a PBIP from scratch.** Power BI Desktop generates boilerplate (`report.json`,
   `.platform`, `version.json`, real GUIDs, theme registration) that is version specific and
   not practical to hand write. Always start from a PBIP the user already saved from Desktop.
2. **Power BI Desktop must be closed** while you write files. Desktop holds the project open
   and will overwrite your changes from its in memory copy on save, or the files may be locked.
3. **Back up first.** Copy the `.Report` folder, or make sure it is committed to git, before
   writing anything.
4. **Validate after writing.** Parse every JSON file you wrote before telling the user to
   reopen Desktop. A missing comma or bracket blocks the whole report from loading.
5. **Prefer the theme over bespoke visual formatting.** Put color and font choices in the
   report's theme JSON (see `guidelines/house-default-theme.json`) rather than repeating them
   in every `visual.json`. Change it once, it applies everywhere.

## Workflow

1. Confirm a PBIP already exists and Power BI Desktop is closed. If there is no PBIP yet,
   stop and have the user create one: open Desktop, connect the data source, File, Save As,
   Power BI Project (.pbip).
2. Read `references/pbir-structure-and-safety.md` for the folder layout and the safe editing
   steps.
3. Detect the schema version already in use. Read one existing `visual.json` in the project
   and reuse its `$schema` value. Do not hardcode a version, Desktop's version changes over
   time and a mismatch causes errors.
4. Pick the visual type and query roles for what the user wants. Read
   `references/visual-types-and-patterns.md` for the catalog and worked examples.
5. Work out layout using `references/layout-and-schema-versions.md`, which follows the same
   8 pixel grid as `guidelines/design-principles.md`.
6. Write the files: the page folder, `page.json`, each visual's folder and `visual.json`,
   then update `pages/pages.json` to add the new page to `pageOrder`.
7. Validate every JSON file you wrote parses cleanly.
8. Tell the user the files are written, Desktop must stay closed until now, and to reopen
   the `.pbip` to see the result.

## Rules of thumb

- Name pages and visuals descriptively (`pgOverview`, `vSalesBarChart`), not with random IDs.
  The `name` field inside a JSON file must match its folder name exactly.
- `Entity` and `Property` values in a field reference are the exact table and column or
  measure name from the semantic model, case sensitive. Check the TMDL if unsure.
- A slicer, chart axis, or table needs at least one query role filled (for example `Category`
  and `Y` for a bar chart, `Values` for a slicer). See the catalog for the exact roles.
- Keep conditional formatting logic in a model or extension measure that returns a color
  string, referencing the theme's semantic `good` and `bad` colors, rather than a hardcoded
  hex value repeated in many visuals.
- If the user wants a variance or actual versus plan style chart, that is a legitimate pattern
  (IBCS calls it a comparison chart), but use the house theme's colors for it, not a borrowed
  palette. See `powerbi-report-design` for the color rules.
- A title or a card can be bound to a measure that returns a string, so it updates with the
  filters. Watch the grain, the measure is read at the whole visual level, so a per row ratio
  measure overstates unless you aggregate it (a weighted total, or `AVERAGEX` over the entity). See
  `references/visual-types-and-patterns.md`.

  in use instead of hardcoding one.
