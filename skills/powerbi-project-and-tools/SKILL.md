# Power BI project and tools

This skill covers the Power BI project files (pbip and TMDL) and the free external tools you
use around a model on Pro. It also draws the license line: what runs on Pro versus what needs
Premium or Fabric. This is the skill where the license boundary matters most. For the hard
facts, read `references/pro-vs-premium-facts.md` in this skill.

## When to use

Use this when the user wants to:

- Understand or hand edit the pbip and TMDL files that define a model.
- Pick or use a free tool: Tabular Editor 2, DAX Studio, VertiPaq Analyzer, Bravo, Measure Killer.
- Run the Best Practice Analyzer, check model size, or find unused measures and columns.
- Know what is Pro versus Premium versus Fabric, or whether an XMLA tool edit will work.

For M and refresh use `powerbi-data-and-refresh`. For star schema use `powerbi-modeling`. For
DAX use `powerbi-dax`. For report layout use `powerbi-report-design`. To stand up a documented,
redacted repo for a model use `powerbi-doc-repo`.

## The one license fact that trips people up

All the tools here edit your LOCAL pbip or pbix, and that works on Pro. Writing changes back to
a dataset already PUBLISHED in a Pro workspace needs the XMLA write endpoint, and XMLA write is
Premium, not Pro. So on Pro the loop is always: edit the local file with the tool, then
republish from Power BI Desktop. See `references/licensing-cheatsheet.md`.

## Workflow for a hand edit of the model files

1. Back up first. Copy the whole project folder, or commit to git, so you can revert.
2. Close Power BI Desktop before you touch the files. Desktop holds the model in memory and
   writes the TMDL files from memory when it saves. Edits made while it is open get clobbered.
   Desktop also does not watch the files, so it only picks up your edits on a fresh open.
3. Make one minimal, targeted edit at a time. Change a single property or measure, then verify.
4. Keep the encoding UTF-8 without BOM and keep the CRLF line endings. Preserve the tab
   indentation. TMDL structure is whitespace significant, one tab per level.
5. Reopen in Desktop to verify. If an edit is invalid, Desktop refuses to open and names the
   file and the line of the error.

## Rules of thumb

- TMDL is the source of truth for the model. The `.pbi\cache.abf` is just cached data, not the
  definition. Edit the `.tmdl` files, not the cache.
- You can flip a table between an import (M) partition and a calculated (DAX) partition by editing
  TMDL, but only if you delete `.pbi\cache.abf` first so Desktop rebuilds fresh from the TMDL.
  Reopening with the cache in place fails on open with
  `PFE_TM_DDL_CHANGED_PARTITION_FROM_OR_TO_CALC`. This is the light way to kill refresh fan out. See
  `references/pbip-and-tmdl.md`.
- Keep the pbip repo out of a OneDrive or SharePoint synced folder. OneDrive plus git in one
  folder can corrupt the repo, and Desktop cannot save a pbip cleanly into a synced folder.
- Pick the tool for the job. Bulk measure edits and the Best Practice Analyzer go to Tabular
  Editor 2. Model size and query timings go to DAX Studio with VertiPaq Analyzer. Quick size
  check, DAX formatting, and a Date table go to Bravo. Unused measures and columns go to
  Measure Killer. See `references/external-tools.md`.
- On Pro these tools edit the LOCAL file, then you republish. Connecting a tool to WRITE to a
  published dataset over XMLA is Premium.
