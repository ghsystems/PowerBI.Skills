# Ratios and totals that do not lie

Measures that are right on every row and wrong on the total row, and how to fix them. Also
covers releasing specific filters, collapsing duplicate source rows, and cumulative totals
over a non date column. All confirmed in a live production model.

## The problem

A ratio whose denominator is an AVERAGE, or any ratio that is not additive, is correct per
entity and meaningless at the total. Power BI computes the total by evaluating the same
expression once over all visible rows, so the total becomes a ratio of two grand totals, not
the average of the row ratios.

Nothing errors. The row values look right, so nobody checks the total. This is the most
repeated technique in the production model and the most common silent wrong number in Power
BI.

The fix is always the same shape. Detect whether you are on a leaf row or a total, and switch
to an explicit AVERAGEX over the entity when you are on the total.

## The HASONEVALUE form

```dax
Task Capacity vs Planned Capacity =
VAR PerSprintRatio =
    DIVIDE ( SUM ( fact_effort[Effort (Hours)] ), AVERAGE ( fact_effort[Planned Capacity (Hours)] ) )
RETURN
IF (
    HASONEVALUE ( fact_effort[Sprint] ),
    PerSprintRatio,
    AVERAGEX (
        VALUES ( fact_effort[Sprint] ),
        CALCULATE ( DIVIDE ( SUM ( fact_effort[Effort (Hours)] ), AVERAGE ( fact_effort[Planned Capacity (Hours)] ) ) )
    )
)
```

The CALCULATE inside AVERAGEX is doing the work. It turns each sprint row into a filter
(context transition) so the ratio is computed per sprint, then the mean of those ratios is
returned.

## The ISFILTERED variant, dropping empty rows first

```dax
Capacity Utilization (%) =
VAR HasSprintFilter = ISFILTERED ( fact_capacity[Sprint] )
RETURN
IF (
    HasSprintFilter,
    DIVIDE ( SUM ( fact_capacity[Total Effort (Hours)] ), SUM ( fact_capacity[Max Capacity (Hours)] ), 0 ),
    AVERAGEX (
        FILTER ( VALUES ( fact_capacity[Sprint] ), CALCULATE ( SUM ( fact_capacity[Max Capacity (Hours)] ) ) > 0 ),
        CALCULATE ( DIVIDE ( SUM ( fact_capacity[Total Effort (Hours)] ), SUM ( fact_capacity[Max Capacity (Hours)] ), 0 ) )
    )
)
```

The `FILTER ( VALUES ( ... ), CALCULATE ( ... ) > 0 )` matters. A sprint with zero capacity
returns a ratio of zero, and AVERAGEX counts it, so a few empty sprints drag the mean toward
zero. Removing them before averaging is the difference between a believable number and a
number the business will argue with.

Which test to use:

- HASONEVALUE is true when exactly one value of the column is visible. Use it when the visual
  has that column on its axis, so the leaf row really is one sprint.
- ISFILTERED is true when the column is filtered at all, from any source including a slicer.
  Use it when the slicer, not the axis, is what narrows the calculation.

Pick by which one matches your visual. Getting this wrong sends you down the wrong branch and
the result looks like the total problem you were fixing.

## The same trap on cards and titles

A card has no axis, so it always evaluates at the whole visual grain. That is the total row by
another name, and an unguarded ratio on a card is wrong for the same reason. A dynamic title
built from a measure has the same shape. For the title version see the
`powerbi-pbir-builder` skill.

## DIVIDE with or without the third argument

Both are correct. The third argument is a display decision, so make it deliberately.

- `DIVIDE ( n, d, 0 )` when a chart reads better with a zero mark on the axis, so a gap does
  not look like missing data.
- `DIVIDE ( n, d )` when blank should suppress the row or the mark, which is what you want in a
  matrix so empty combinations do not print as zeros.

Apply the choice consistently across a report or the two behaviours look like a bug.

## REMOVEFILTERS over specific columns

`references/patterns.md` shows `ALL ( Table )` and `ALLSELECTED ( Table )`. Percent of parent
in a matrix needs something narrower. Release the columns that define the parent and hold
everything else.

```dax
Activity % of Month =
VAR Num = SUM ( 'fact_effort'[Effort (Hours)] )
VAR Den = CALCULATE ( SUM ( 'fact_effort'[Effort (Hours)] ), REMOVEFILTERS ( 'fact_effort'[Activity], 'fact_effort'[Team] ) )
RETURN DIVIDE ( Num, Den )
```

For a two axis matrix, release whole dimension tables instead.

```dax
Task Updates % of Grand Total =
VAR Num = COUNT ( fact_task_activity[Task Number] )
VAR Den = CALCULATE ( COUNT ( fact_task_activity[Task Number] ), REMOVEFILTERS ( dim_day ), REMOVEFILTERS ( dim_hour ) )
RETURN DIVIDE ( Num, Den )
```

`ALL ( fact_effort )` would be wrong in the first case and `ALL` over the fact would be wrong
in the second. Both release the sprint and company slicers too, so the denominator becomes the
whole model rather than the whole page. The percentages then sum to less than 100 and nobody
can explain why.

## MAXX over FILTER to collapse duplicate source rows

When the source can hold more than one row per key, SUM at the leaf silently doubles. Take one
value instead of adding them.

```dax
VAR PlannedVacation =
    MAXX (
        FILTER ( fact_planning, fact_planning[Sprint] = ThisSprint && fact_planning[Team Member] = ThisOwner ),
        fact_planning[Vacation/Sick Days (Days)]
    )
```

MAX and MIN both work when the duplicates are identical. MAXX is the safe default because it
also survives a source that emits a partial and a corrected row for the same key.

## The residual bucket

When a set of categories must total exactly 100 percent of a known whole, define the last
bucket as the remainder rather than as its own sum.

```dax
VAR AdminH = FullCap - MSH - PSH - PreSaleH - MappedInternal - IncCRH - UnavailH
```

Everything unaccounted for lands there by construction, including unlogged hours and rows in
categories nobody mapped. The buckets always add to the whole, which is what a stacked chart
or a share matrix needs.

The trade is real. The residual bucket absorbs data quality problems silently, so a broken
mapping upstream shows up as a fat Admin number and not as an error. Put a comment in the
measure saying that, so the next person reads the bucket as a remainder and not as a fact.

## Cumulative or burn up over a non date column

The running total in `references/patterns.md` assumes `'Date'[Date]`. The same shape works
over any ordered column, so a burn up against a flat estimate needs no date table and no time
intelligence.

```dax
PS Cumulative vs Estimate % =
DIVIDE (
    CALCULATE (
        SUM ( dim_work_item[Task Effort (Hours)] ),
        FILTER ( ALLSELECTED ( dim_work_item[LUD Month] ), dim_work_item[LUD Month] <= MAX ( dim_work_item[LUD Month] ) )
    ),
    CALCULATE (
        SUM ( fact_estimate_ps[Estimate of Effort] ),
        TREATAS ( ALLSELECTED ( dim_work_item[Company] ), fact_estimate_ps[Company] ),
        TREATAS ( ALLSELECTED ( dim_work_item[Epic Number] ), fact_estimate_ps[Epic Number] )
    ),
    0
)
```

The numerator accumulates and the denominator is flat. That is the burn up shape. The column
being accumulated only has to sort correctly, so a `YYYY-MM` text month works. For the TREATAS
part see `references/virtual-relationships.md`.
